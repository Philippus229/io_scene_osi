# io_scene_osi (Odyssey Stage Importer)
A Blender 2.79 add-on for importing Super Mario Odyssey stages.

## Usage
1. Install the add-on if you haven't already and set "Models" path to the path of the Odyssey Editor "Models" directory.
2. Open the stage (and scenario) you want to import in Odyssey Editor to convert the models to OBJ format.
3. In Blender, go to "File"->"Import"->"SMO Stage (.byml/.szs)", select the SZS (or BYML) of the stage you want to import, set the value of "Scenario" to the scenario you want to load (0-14) and import the stage by clicking on "Import Stage".
